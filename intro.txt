Statically VS. Dynamically Typed:

Java -> Static
 - Whatever you declare to be the type is what it is for the rest of this object's life.
 - Compile-time checking for type matching.

Python -> Dynamic
 - You are only really assigning an object that has a type to a variable.  
 - Said object has a type, but the variable doesn't
